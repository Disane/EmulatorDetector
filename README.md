# EmulatorDetectorJava
This is a simple Emulator Detector written in Java. Most of the code is based on public code available on StackOverflow.
As it turns out people like to copy and paste code from forums.

This simple demonstration shows how easy it is to get around Emulator detection using dynamic analysis that involves instrumentation through Frida.

The FridaScripts folder holds the scripts used to instrument the Example App.
